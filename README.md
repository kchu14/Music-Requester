# Music-Requester
This project is for adding songs to a Spotify playlist via text messages. Useful for when people come over and you don't want to give them access to the playlist.
## Getting Started
To start you need to make a Spotify and Twilio account and note the API keys.

### Prerequisites

Python, Spotify account with API keys, Twilio account with API keys

### Installing

I suggest you follow the documentation for setting up Twilio (linked below)
https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python

After that has been completed you need to add the following as environment variables...
- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET
- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID
- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
- TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
